## FAQ

**Is Procaptcha visible only to unauthorized users?**

Yes, by default, Procaptcha is shown only to unauthorized users. You can change this in the `behavior` section of the plugin settings, or using the plugin hooks.

Note: However, some plugins, such as Contact Form 7, don't send user data during submission, so Procaptcha is displayed to all users in those cases.

## Advanced Usage 

Visit the Hooks section to explore how you can further customize the plugin's behavior.
