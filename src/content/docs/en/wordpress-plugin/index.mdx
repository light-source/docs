Procaptcha has an [official WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/prosopo-procaptcha/), enabling seamless integration with your WordPress site.

## Installation

1. Visit your WordPress admin panel, and go to **Plugins** > **Add New**, then search for **Procaptcha** and click **Install Now**.
2. Once the installation is complete, click **Activate**.
3. Navigate to the plugin settings (**Settings > Procaptcha**) and enter your site key and secret key, which you can obtain from the [Prosopo user portal](https://portal.prosopo.io/).
4. Save the settings

If the credentials are correct, you'll see the Procaptcha displayed on the right side of the settings page.

## WordPress Core Forms

Procaptcha supports WordPress core forms out-of-the-box, including Login, Registration, Lost Password, Comments, and Post/Page password protection forms. It also works with custom login URLs, like those created by [WPS Hide Login](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wps-hide-login/).

To enable protection for these forms, go to the plugin settings and toggle the corresponding options.

## Third-party Form Plugins

Procaptcha integrates with many popular form plugins. Check the pages in this section for detailed instructions on how to enable it for specific form plugins.

## FAQ

**Is Procaptcha visible only to unauthorized users?**

Yes, by default, Procaptcha is shown only to unauthorized users. 
However, some plugins, such as Contact Form 7, don't send user data during submission, so Procaptcha is displayed to all users in those cases.

If you would like to force Procaptcha display for authorized users, refer to the `is_captcha_present` section in the Hooks page.
