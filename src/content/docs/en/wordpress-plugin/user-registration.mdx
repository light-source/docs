The Procaptcha plugin extends [User Registration & Membership](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-registration/):

1. By registering the `Prosopo Procaptcha` field, which you can easily add to your registration forms for Procaptcha protection.

To enable this, open the target form and insert the `Prosopo Procaptcha` field anywhere in the form, above the `Submit` button.

2. By extending the custom login and password reset forms.

The User Registration plugin allows not only to create signup forms, but also craft login and lost password forms. 
These forms inherit the functionality of the core WordPress account forms, and Prosopo supports them as part of the core WordPress forms.

Visit the Procaptcha plugin settings to enable protection for target account forms.
