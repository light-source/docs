The Procaptcha plugin extends [Fluent Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fluentform/) by registering the `Prosopo Procaptcha` field, which you can easily add to your forms for Procaptcha protection.

To enable this, open the target form and insert the `Prosopo Procaptcha` field anywhere in the form, above the `Submit` button.
