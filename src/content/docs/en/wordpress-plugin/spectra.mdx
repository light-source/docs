The Procaptcha plugin supports the [forms feature](https://wpspectra.com/docs/spectra-forms-block/) of the [Spectra plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-addons-for-gutenberg/).

To add Procaptcha to any Spectra Gutenberg form, follow these steps:

1. Select the desired Form block in the Gutenberg editor
2. Add a hidden input field: click on the plus icon and opt for the 'hidden' field
3. Use `prosopo_procaptcha` as the hidden field name and value
4. Save the page

That's it! Now you can open the page (as an unauthorized user) to see the Procaptcha widget in the place of the hidden field.
