**Forum forms**

The Procaptcha plugin extends [bbPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) by adding the `Prosopo Procaptcha` setting to every forum.

Visit the target forum setting to enable protection for topic creation and reply forms.

**Account pages**

bbPress comes with a [row of shortcodes](https://codex.bbpress.org/features/shortcodes/), which allow to make custom account forms: register, login and lost password. They inherit the core WordPress account forms, which means these forms are supported by Prosopo as part of the core WordPress forms.

Visit the Procaptcha plugin settings to enable protection for target account forms.
