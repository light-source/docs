The Procaptcha plugin supports the [forms feature](https://jetpack.com/forms/) of the [JetPack plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/).

To add Procaptcha to any JetPack Gutenberg form, follow these steps:

1. Add the [Group block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/) inside the target form block
2. Add the [Shortcode block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/shortcode-block/) inside the added Group block
3. Insert the `[prosopo_procaptcha]` inside the added Shortcode block
4. Save the page

That's it! Now you can open the page (as an unauthorized user) to see the Procaptcha widget inside the form.
