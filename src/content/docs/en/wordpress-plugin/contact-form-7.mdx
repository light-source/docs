The Procaptcha plugin extends [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) by registering the `[prosopo_procaptcha]` field, which you can easily add to your forms for CAPTCHA protection.

To enable this, open the target form and insert the `[prosopo_procaptcha]` field anywhere in the form, above the `[submit]` button.
